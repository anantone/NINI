<h1>Presenting NINI - A program for sourcing Natural Intelligence</h1>

<p>Even though this project <em>was</em> born yesterday, nobody remembers if NINI stands for "Natural Intelligence Neuronal Incubator" or "Natural Intelligence: Naturally Intelligent". There was also a debate about pronouncing it "nini" or "N-I-ni", but as mentioned, we were all a bit tipsy last night.</p>

<p>In truth, what we proudly present here is a Natural Intelligence Enabler, we just needed a better acronym! Functionally, though, it <em>enables</em>, or stimulates, an old resource recently renamed, out of historical necessity, Natural Intelligence (as opposed to the newer one).</p>

<p>There is a geeky "haha" side (or two or three) to this project, but also a semi-serious attempt to ask, in the age of A.I., the question of meaning. The features offered by this program, each in their own way, have in common to replicate some of the tasks that A.I. now, to general acclaim, can accomplish, but with a twist which underlines how, maybe, there is in Natural Intelligence the possibility of a meaning that escapes the machine (and the machine-dependent human).</p>

<h2>Searching for Godot</h2>

<p>The first feature, a search functionality directly using the Wikipedia Python library, shows how collecting information about a topic has become in itself a trivial task; but more than the power to crawl the Internet to Mars and back, what matters here is the ability to evaluate the source of our information. As some of the incongruities and mistakes recently produced by A.I. amusingly show, but the extension of the notion of "truthiness" from programming to politics more tragically forewarns, this is not an ability that humans can harmlessly delegate.</p>

<p>An essential component of intelligence, and therefore of freedom, is to know how to evaluate a source of information. How accurate is Wikipedia? Mostly, for the subjects that we personally research, very; but they are subjects with nothing at stake except knowledge. We are told by relatives involved in worldly affairs that its accuracy isn't to be trusted in every case, for instance when money or reputation are involved. Nonetheless, it seems like a good place to start for: discussing the importance of evaluating information sources; and learning about many things (but then one needs to evaluate the sources of the Wikipedia pages, and so on).</p>

<h2>The Human Within</h2>

<p>The second feature, a quick writing workshop guiding users to "generate creative content", in this case penning a haiku (a three-line poem of 5, 7, and 5 syllables, imitated from an old Japanese form), is more controversial, even within the team behind NINI. As one of us recently heard from his husband: "Yeah, sure, you made me write a haiku, but then you just gave it back to me. Your program did nothing with it." Which seems to miss the point, which was to make <em>him</em> write the haiku.</p>

<p>In this case, the provided prompts intend to enable anyone, with or without previous experience with poetry, to write a small poem which possesses some meaning. To support this premise and further discuss what this "meaning" means, we will offer a brief analysis of the three haikus provided as examples in the program, which were created "off the cuff" by members of our team.</p>

<h3>Of Mountains and Shadows</h3>

<p><em>By a mountain lake</br>Dark grey clouds fill up the sky</br>Suddenly I'm cold</em></p>

<p>As prompted, the first line describes a place. This is a pretty simple one, but with a potential for natural beauty. Readers who have seen a mountain lake before will get a stronger connection (visual and emotional) based on their experience.</p>

<p>The second line describes a change in weather. It is a dark, heavy, rather ominous change. Bad weather in mountains can be more dangerous than elsewhere. It also implies that earlier, the sky had been clear. Now the situation is getting worse. Also, the lake would reflect the colors of the sky, becoming dark grey as well, instead of the clear transparent waters typical of mountain lakes. It is all getting dark quickly.</p>

<p>The third line describes a sensation from an "I" who is assumed to be up there. Again, for those who know mountains, temperatures can changes pretty swiftly, especially when the sun get hidden by clouds or crosses over to the other side of the mountain. It can feel very disheartening, as if the sun were never to reappear. If this sensation is known to the reader, it should strike a chord; if it isn't, one should still be able to get a sense of what this moment is like for the person involved. </p>

<h3>Different Kinds of Parties</h3>

<p><em>Copacabana</br>The waitress folds her apron</br>Another cocktail?</em></p>

<p>The first line started as a joke on how to describe a place in only five syllables. It so happens that this proper noun is very evocative: rightly or wrongly, most people get a tropical "beach party" vibe from this particular five-syllable sequence.</p>

<p>The second line describes a change, while also narrowing down the physical location. We are in a bar or restaurant, places where waitresses work. This particular waitress folds her apron: from an undefined point of view, "we" see her (the reader sees her, through whose eyes is undefined: a customer would be a reasonable assumption). The folding of her apron suggests that maybe her shift is over, or she is going on a break.</p>

<p>The third line is a question related, most likely, to the unspecified observer. Many different, fun hypotheses come to mind: if I have been drinking, but am interested in the waitress who is now off-duty, should I <em>not</em> get another cocktail and go talk to her instead? Two competing temptations to consider, especially if I'm a serious drinker. Or maybe I am more interested in her than in booze and am imagining "another kind of cocktail", or pleasure, which she might invite me to share with her? Or maybe I'm a desperate drunk and about to beg the waitress for one last cocktail before she leaves. Or maybe I'm going to order two cocktails from the other bartender and ask the waitress if she'll have one with me, thus redefining the terms of our interaction from professional to potentially friendly. That makes a lot of possible stories, from just three short lines, and some of us could keep going.</p>

<h3>What is an Overgrown Path?</h3>

<p><em>My mother's garden</br>Overgrown weeds everywhere</br>How tired one gets</em></p>

<p>The first line is very generic, but emotional. The garden could be any type of garden, and depending on which part of the world one comes from, many different gardens can be imagined here. But they all are "my mother's". People universally have feelings about mothers.</p>

<p>The second line describes a change which has left the garden in disarray. There could be many reasons for that, but mostly sad ones come to mind. Maybe mother is ill. Maybe mother has died. On the upside, maybe mother is having an affair with the gardener who thus neglects his or her work.</p>

<p>The third line describes a sense of tiredness, implicitly related to the state of the garden. Is it that mother is ill and too tired to tend her garden as she used to? Or that mother has died, and the son or daughter is returning to the unkempt garden, measuring by its poor condition the time that has passed since mother's passing? Or the son or daughter was supposed to take care of mother's garden and for their own reasons (which could include the pain caused by her death), they have felt too tired and let the weeds overgrow? Or mother is again having an affair with the staff, and it gets tiring to have to sort out the aftereffects of her dalliances? (etc.)</p>

<h2>Argument</h2>

<p>These are not even very good haikus. But they don't have to be. As a simple writing exercise, with prompts attempting to elicit the necessary elements, this feature enables anyone to write a not very good haiku, but a decently functioning one nonetheless.</p>

<p>This haiku will at least have meaning for the person who wrote it (since the prompts explicitly call for a place that is meaningful to <em>you</em>, and build from there). As the examples above intended to show, other readers can also construe some kind of meaning from these very simple elements. This meaning will take shape based on each reader's personal experiences, bringing different images and associations, even potential stories of varying length and complexity, to their own reading of the haiku. </p>

<p>Granted, this isn't much, and no, the program doesn't do anything to your words (except checking that you can count to five and seven). But the words still convey, and potentially elicit, a meaningful state of consciousness for the humans who interact with them. </p>

<p>On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence impressively imitates the style of well-known writers, creating sentences that do indeed "sound like" they could have been written by Edgar Allan Poe. But reading those still has little in common with reading a story written by Poe. Of all the grammatically correct ways that Poe could combine the words of his favorite atmospheres (or lexical fields), he chose some very specific ones. Presumably, they had meaning for him. Presumably, readers find meaning in them. Now if your A.I. produces a thousand stories that "sound like Poe", or a million, at what rate would their meaning start decreasing, and why?</p>

<p>As a comparison, consider a TV drama which, because of its success, gets renewed for too many seasons (insert your own example). Initially, the characters had engaged us in a personal way, as we projected our own feelings and experiences, and related to them in specific ways (allowing many people to connect with the same characters is one possible definition of good commercial drama). But now, the writers or their successors are being forced by financial interest to continue the story much beyond what was initially conceived. To that end, characters have to change, so they do change, they change again and again, until any good drama becomes a shallow soap opera. Because the overloaded characters are called to take any and all of their possible shapes, they provide more scenes and advertising revenue, but they lose progressively their meaning, what made them unique in the first place, the unique way in which each of us related to them. As our engagement with the characters inevitably dissolves, often with regret, another good show bites the dust. The thing is, initially, of all the potential versions of these characters, the writers had picked one. Presumably the strongest. Which had the most meaning to them, or they thought would have meaning for the greatest variety of other humans.</p>

<p>Computational linguistics is a fascinating field, and indeed the powers of literary imitation of A.I. are impressive. But they may also serve to remind us why we cared to read in the first place: because it touched us, as human beings. Knowing that the text came from another such being, while more a source of imaginary projections than actual "communication", was still an integral part of what made us care (and one only reads if one cares). Now, it seems confirmed that humans can fall in love with their A.I., so limitless are the powers of projection of emotionally needy humans. While these may develop into fulfilling relationships in some instances, we'll see, we would like to argue that human-to-human contact will remain essential to our species, since that is what built it. Will remain a favorite cocktail. Call us old-fashioned.</p>

<p>This small creative writing exercise aims for any user to experience, no matter how clunky their haiku, that an exchange of meaning, such as happens when humans read and write a poem, is quite different in nature, more fragile and introspective, less economically relevant also, from the powerful skills of association displayed by A.I. </p>

<p>Similarly, the search feature previously discussed points out that learning isn't about amassing troves of material, but becoming able to discern, for oneself, the quality of these materials as reliable sources of information. Natural Intelligence is a bit less about computational power (at least as far as we are aware), and more about evaluating what is meaningful to each of us, and why. This skill had long remained implicit, and only as we neglect to cultivate it, mesmerized by the beautiful soup produced by a million almost-Shakespeare pounding typewriters, does it resurface as an essential part of our humanity: having a mind that thinks freely, with the ability to form opinions that are intimately our own, yet at the same time determined by a sense of truth and integrity derived from direct personal contact with the world and our connections with other human people.</p>

<h2>Back Toward the Future</h2>

<p>In a simple way, this is what the features of this jokey program are hoping to suggest. Of course, many more examples can be envisioned, and certainly much better ones! This is why, considering that the ability to learn and evolve is integral to any type of Intelligence, our third and currently last feature is a suggestion box for new features. Again, the user will have to muster their own Natural Intelligence, if they want to complete the task. The program, as we hope is clear by now, does not provide any.</p>
