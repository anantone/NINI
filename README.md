NINI is a Natural Intelligence Enabler, and final project for [Code in Place 5](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/)!

It is essentially a small Python program which uses Natural Intelligence, or N.I., a past-generation form of A.I. It only has three features for now:
* gathering information about a topic of your choice.
* generating creative, structured, linguistic content.
* suggesting further enablement modalities.

The best way to get an idea of what this is about is to try the Web App at [https://anbarto.pythonanywhere.com](https://anbarto.pythonanywhere.com/). Code for the webapp is in the "bottle" folder of this repository.

One can also try the initial CLI version by setting up a virtual environment with the necessary packages, from the code in the "nini-cli" folder.

A more thorough description of the project is provided in the technically white paper.
